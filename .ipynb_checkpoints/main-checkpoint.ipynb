    "# Fairness of scholastic aptitude test in New York City\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will aim to find how fair is the scholastic aptitude test (SAT) for the diverse student population in the schools of New York, US. The test consists of three section, each of which has a maximum score of 800. The combined maximum score is 2400. Since, the sat scores are used by colleges for admission of students, it is important that the test offers a fair chance to every student, irrespective of their race, gender, income and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will analyze the existing data about the sat test takers to judge its fairness. We will try to find out the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the correlation between the average sat scores and the demographics of different schools in the dataset\n",
    "- the correlation between the percentage of male and female students in a school versus the average sat scores of that school\n",
    "- the correlation between the sat scores and other metrics such as the overall school district quality."

    "\n",
    "After analyzing the data, we found evidence that the SAT exams are unfair towards black and hispanic student population as compared to white and asian student population. Upon further investigation, we found that a possible reason for the poor performance of hispanic students could be the poor english skills. We also found that, the females perform better in the SAT exams than male student population.  "
